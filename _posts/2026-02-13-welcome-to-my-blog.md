# Welcome to My New Blog!

Hello everyone! I'm excited to announce the launch of my personal blog. This has been on my TODO list for a while, and today I finally made it happen.

## Why Start a Blog?

As a software engineer, I believe in:
1. **Sharing knowledge** - What I learn might help others
2. **Documenting progress** - Tracking my own learning journey
3. **Improving communication** - Writing helps clarify thinking
4. **Building a portfolio** - Showcasing projects and ideas

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:
- **Technology** - Programming tips, tutorials, and insights
- **Projects** - Updates on my personal and professional work
- **AI & ML** - Thoughts on artificial intelligence developments
- **Career** - Software engineering experiences and advice
- **Random thoughts** - Whatever else comes to mind!

## First Technical Project: nanobot-webui

Currently, I'm working on enhancing my AI assistant project called **nanobot-webui**. Some upcoming features include:
1. **GLM Integration** - Adding support for ChatGLM models
2. **Agent Team** - Implementing multi-agent collaboration
3. **Web Interface Improvements** - Better UX and functionality

## Getting Started with GitHub Pages

Setting up this blog was surprisingly straightforward with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Here's the basic process:

```bash
# Create repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial blog setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/codemo1991/chris.github.io
git push -u origin master
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings, and your site goes live at `https://linjifeng.github.io`.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to start this blogging journey. If you have suggestions for topics or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out!

**Next up**: I'll be sharing my experience implementing GLM API integration in nanobot-webui.

Stay tuned! 🚀
